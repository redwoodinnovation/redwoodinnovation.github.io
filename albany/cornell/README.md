# Cornell Elementary School 

A Github webpage displaying:

- Circles (nodes) which may change location, color, or size in response to changes in Google Sheet values.

- Single polygons (areas) which change color in response to changes in "Cornell room sensors" or "Picarro4PM" Google Sheet values.

- Single polygons (areas) which display the outline of the OSM School Buildings & School Grounds.

- Lines (ways) which display OSM roads and paths.

## CO2 Sensor Data

- The property polygon displays the outside CO2 value per the CO2 color gradient. Data from 4pm the previous day is pulled into a Google Sheet via Google Apps Script each morning between 9 and 10 AM. Thease data are are stored in the "Picarro4PM" Google Sheet 

- CO2 - Level 0 & Level 1 ppm values are shown per room polygon and are manually entered in the "Cornell room sensors" Google Sheet. Fixed room sensor data may be at an hourly interval or reported as a max daily, weekly, or monthly value. 

- CO2 - Crowdsense mobile CO2 ppm values are entered with the "CO2 Crowdsense" Google Form wherein participants enter longitude, latitude, Level, and Room # (when applicable), and are stored in the "CO2 Crowdsense (response)" Google Sheet.

## Resource Data

- Electricity (kWh), natural gas (kBTU), and water (gal) are manually entered with the "Meter Reading Form" Google Form and are displayed as a circle node which changes size.

## Geometry

- Map geometry and meter legend are rendered using d3.js.

- Room polygons are geojson files stored in GitHub and are tagged as Level 0 or Level 1. 

- Streets and building outlines are geojson generated by overpass-turbo export and stored locally. 

- Tree and entrance nodes are loaded per the screen bounding box via Overpass API.

- CO2 PPM color gradient SVG code generated by Inkscape. 

- Layer toggles are html + css.
